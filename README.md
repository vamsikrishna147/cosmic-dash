üöÄ Cosmic Dash
A fast-paced, endless arcade dodger set in the vastness of space. Built with pure HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, this lightweight game is designed for quick, engaging sessions on both desktop and mobile.

‚ú® About The Game
Cosmic Dash is a modern take on the classic arcade survival genre. The player controls a lone starship navigating a treacherous asteroid field. The objective is simple: survive as long as possible by dodging a progressively dense barrage of asteroids and wrecked spaceship debris. With responsive controls, a live online leaderboard, and a clean, retro-futuristic aesthetic, Cosmic Dash is easy to learn but hard to master.

üéÆ Gameplay & Features
Endless Survival: The game continues indefinitely with the difficulty (speed and frequency of obstacles) ramping up as your score increases.

Multiple Obstacle Types: Dodge not only procedurally generated asteroids but also tumbling wrecked spaceship debris.

Player Lives: You start with three lives, giving you a chance to recover from mistakes.

Shield Power-up: Occasionally, a Shield Power-up will appear. Collect it to protect your ship from a single impact.

Dynamic Visuals: The game is rendered on the HTML5 Canvas and features a scrolling starfield, particle explosions, and a screen-shake effect upon impact.

Ship Customization: Players can choose their ship's color from the main menu before starting a game.

Responsive Controls:

Polished UI: A clean, non-intrusive UI displays your score and lives, with intuitive menus for starting, pausing, and retrying.
